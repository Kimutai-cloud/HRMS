# Task Management System - Phase 2 Complete Implementation

## Overview
Phase 2 (Repository & Use Cases) of the task management system has been successfully implemented and tested. This phase builds on Phase 1's database foundation to provide a complete business logic and data access layer.

## Implementation Summary

### Database Schema (Phase 1 Foundation)
- **5 ENUMs**: task_type_enum, priority_enum, task_status_enum, comment_type_enum, task_action_enum
- **3 Tables**: 
  - `tasks` (27 columns) - Core task data with relationships, progress, timeline
  - `task_comments` (7 columns) - Task communication and collaboration
  - `task_activities` (8 columns) - Complete audit trail
- **22 Indexes** for optimal query performance
- **Foreign Key Constraints** ensuring data integrity with employees and departments

- TaskComment and TaskActivity entities
- Full workflow validation and business rules

#### Domain Events (Phase 1)
**File: `Employee-Service/app/core/entities/events.py`**
- 11 domain events for complete task lifecycle:
  - TaskCreatedEvent, TaskAssignedEvent, TaskStartedEvent
  - TaskProgressUpdatedEvent, TaskSubmittedEvent, TaskReviewStartedEvent
  - TaskApprovedEvent, TaskRejectedEvent, TaskCancelledEvent
  - TaskUpdatedEvent, TaskCommentAddedEvent

## Next Steps - Phase 3 (API & Integration)

Phase 2 provides the complete business logic foundation. Phase 3 should focus on:

1. **API Layer**:
   - Task schemas (request/response DTOs)
   - Manager task endpoints
   - Employee task endpoints
   - Comment and activity endpoints

2. **Integration**:
   - WebSocket notifications for real-time updates
   - Email notifications for task assignments
   - Integration with existing auth/permission system
   - Add to main app router

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - File attachment system
   - Task templates
   - Bulk operations
   - Advanced filtering UI

## Database Connection Details
- Host: postgres (docker container)
- Database: hrms_db
- User: hrms_user
- Tables: tasks, task_comments, task_activities
- All constraints and relationships working properly

## Performance Considerations
- 22 database indexes created for optimal query performance
- Repository methods optimized for common query patterns
- Permission-based filtering at database level
- Efficient joins with employee and department tables

The Phase 2 implementation provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for the complete task management system, ready for API integration in Phase 3.
