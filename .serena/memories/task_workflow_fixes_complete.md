# Task Workflow Implementation Complete

## Date: 2025-09-05

## Overview
Fixed broken task workflow by implementing missing frontend UI logic and resolving employee profile validation errors. The complete ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED → APPROVED workflow is now functional.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Frontend Workflow Buttons ✅
**Problem**: Backend APIs existed but frontend lacked status-specific action buttons
- ASSIGNED tasks had no "Start Task" button
- IN_PROGRESS tasks had no "Update Progress" or "Submit" buttons  
- SUBMITTED tasks showed approve/reject to ALL users (not just managers)

**Solution**: Added status-specific buttons to TaskCard component
- ASSIGNED → "Start Task" (blue button)
- IN_PROGRESS → "Update Progress" + "Submit for Review" (when progress = 100%)
- SUBMITTED → "Approve"/"Reject" (manager-only via canManageTasks prop)

### 2. Employee Profile Validation Error ✅  
**Problem**: `Failed to start task: Error: Employee profile required`
**Root Cause**: Task hooks checked `user?.employee_profile_status === 'approved'` but should use `isEmployee` flag

**Solution**: Updated all employee task mutation hooks to use AuthContext's `isEmployee` flag instead of profile status check

### 3. Role-Based Button Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Employees seeing manager approve/reject buttons
**Solution**: Added `canManageTasks` prop to TaskCard with proper role-based rendering

  - Updated useStartTask, useUpdateTaskProgress, useSubmitTask, useEmployeeDashboard, useAssignedTasks

## Current Workflow Status ✅

### Employee Workflow
1. ASSIGNED → Employee sees "Start Task" button → clicks → IN_PROGRESS
2. IN_PROGRESS → Employee sees "Update Progress" → clicks → progress = 100%  
3. IN_PROGRESS (100%) → Employee sees "Submit for Review" → clicks → SUBMITTED
4. Task awaits manager review

### Manager Workflow  
1. SUBMITTED → Manager sees "Approve" and "Reject" buttons
2. Approve → Task moves to COMPLETED
3. Reject → Task moves back to IN_PROGRESS for revision

## Components Using TaskCard

### With Manager Permissions (canManageTasks={true})
- ManagerTaskDashboard - all TaskCard instances
- Shows approve/reject buttons for SUBMITTED tasks

### With Employee Permissions (canManageTasks={false} - default)
- EmployeeTaskDashboard - all TaskCard instances  
- Shows only employee workflow buttons (Start, Update Progress, Submit)

## Database Impact
- 4 previously stuck ASSIGNED tasks can now be started by employees
- Complete workflow cycle now functional end-to-end
- Real-time dashboard updates after actions

## Testing Notes
- Employee profile validation error resolved
- Role-based button visibility working correctly  
- All workflow transitions functional
- Toast notifications provide user feedback
- Dashboard data refreshes after actions

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Consider adding progress percentage input dialog instead of auto-100%
- Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions (reject/approve)
- Implement task reassignment functionality
- Add bulk task operations for managers
