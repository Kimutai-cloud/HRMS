# Task Management System Analysis - Complete Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement
Manager wants ability to assign tasks/projects to employees with full workflow management: create → assign → work → submit → review → complete cycle.

## Analysis Results: EXCELLENT FEASIBILITY

### Perfect System Integration
- ✅ Existing User/Employee system → Task assignees/assigners
- ✅ Department system → Task categorization and scope  
- ✅ Manager-Employee relationships → Assignment permissions
- ✅ Role-based permissions → Task access control
- ✅ WebSocket notifications → Real-time task updates
- ✅ Audit logging → Complete task activity tracking

## Core Workflow Design
```
Manager creates task → Assigns to employee → Employee works → Employee submits → Manager reviews → Manager approves/rejects → Task completed
```

### Task Status State Machine
- DRAFT → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED → IN_REVIEW → COMPLETED
- Alternative flows: CANCELLED (any time), REJECTED (back to IN_PROGRESS)

## Database Schema Design

### Tasks Table (Core)
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    task_type task_type_enum DEFAULT 'TASK', -- PROJECT, TASK, SUBTASK
    priority priority_enum DEFAULT 'MEDIUM', -- LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
    status task_status_enum DEFAULT 'DRAFT', -- Full workflow states
    
    -- Relationships
    assignee_id UUID REFERENCES employees(id),
    assigner_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(id),
    department_id UUID REFERENCES departments(id),
    parent_task_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id), -- For subtasks
    
    -- Progress & Effort
    progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    estimated_hours DECIMAL(5,2),
    actual_hours DECIMAL(5,2),
    
    -- Timeline
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Additional Data
    tags JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
    attachments JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
    review_notes TEXT,
    rejection_reason TEXT,
    approval_notes TEXT,
    version INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);
```

### Supporting Tables
- `task_comments` - Comments and communication
- `task_activities` - Complete audit trail of all changes

### Required ENUMs
- task_type_enum: PROJECT, TASK, SUBTASK
- priority_enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT  
- task_status_enum: DRAFT, ASSIGNED, IN_PROGRESS, SUBMITTED, IN_REVIEW, COMPLETED, CANCELLED

## API Design

### Manager Endpoints
```
POST   /api/v1/manager/tasks                     # Create task
GET    /api/v1/manager/tasks                     # List assigned tasks
POST   /api/v1/manager/tasks/{id}/assign         # Assign to employee
POST   /api/v1/manager/tasks/{id}/review         # Review submitted task
POST   /api/v1/manager/tasks/{id}/approve        # Approve task
POST   /api/v1/manager/tasks/{id}/reject         # Reject with feedback
```

### Employee Endpoints
```
GET    /api/v1/employee/tasks                    # My assigned tasks
PUT    /api/v1/employee/tasks/{id}/progress      # Update progress
POST   /api/v1/employee/tasks/{id}/start         # Start working
POST   /api/v1/employee/tasks/{id}/submit        # Submit for review
```

### Common Endpoints
```
GET    /api/v1/tasks/{id}/comments               # Get comments
POST   /api/v1/tasks/{id}/comments               # Add comment
GET    /api/v1/tasks/{id}/activities             # Activity log
```

## Permission System
| Role | Create | View Own | View Team | Update | Assign | Review |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Employee | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (progress) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Implementation Roadmap (9-13 days total)

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (3-4 days)
- Database ENUMs and tables
- Task entity with business logic
- Domain events for status changes
- Migration script

### Phase 2: Repository & Use Cases (2-3 days)  
- TaskRepository with permission-based queries
- ManagerTaskUseCase (create, assign, review)
- EmployeeTaskUseCase (view, progress, submit)
- Comment and activity management

### Phase 3: API & Integration (2-3 days)
- Task schemas and DTOs
- Manager and employee endpoints
- Integration with existing auth/permission system
- WebSocket notifications

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (2-3 days)
