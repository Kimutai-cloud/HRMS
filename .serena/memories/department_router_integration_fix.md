# Department Router Integration Fix

## Issue Resolved: December 2024

### Problem
The department management components were not loading properly in the React Router setup. Users experienced:
- "Component not found in componentMap" errors for DepartmentManagement, ManagerDepartments, and ManagerDepartmentDetail
- Routes falling back to admin dashboard instead of loading department components
- Duplicate sidebar entries showing "Management > Departments" and "Administration > Departments"

### Root Cause
The department components were properly exported from their respective modules but were missing from the AppRouter.tsx componentMap, which is responsible for mapping route component names to actual React components.

### Solution Applied
1. **Added missing imports to AppRouter.tsx:**
   ```typescript
   import { DepartmentManagement } from '@/components/admin';
   import { ManagerDepartments, ManagerDepartmentDetail } from '@/components/manager';
   ```

2. **Added components to componentMap:**
   ```typescript
   // Admin Panel
   'DepartmentManagement': DepartmentManagement,
   
   // Manager Panel  
   'ManagerDepartments': ManagerDepartments,
   'ManagerDepartmentDetail': ManagerDepartmentDetail,
   ```

3. **Fixed sidebar duplication:**
   - Removed duplicate "Management > Departments" entry
   - Kept only "Administration > Departments" entry pointing to admin departments route

### Routes Now Working
- `/admin/departments` → DepartmentManagement component ✅
- `/manager/departments` → ManagerDepartments component ✅
- `/manager/departments/:id` → ManagerDepartmentDetail component ✅

### Files Modified
- `auth-frontend/src/components/routing/AppRouter.tsx` - Added imports and componentMap entries
- `auth-frontend/src/components/dashboard/AppSidebar.tsx` - Removed duplicate sidebar entry

### Verification
- Console errors for "Component not found" resolved
- Department pages load properly instead of falling back to dashboard
- Clean sidebar navigation with single Departments entry under Administration

### Impact
- Full department management system now accessible via UI
- Admin users can manage departments through proper interface
- Manager users can view their assigned departments
- No more router fallback issues
