## 🔧 **Critical Issues Identified & Resolved**

### **1. Permission Validation Fix (CRITICAL)**
**Issue:** User ID vs Employee ID mismatch causing "Only the task assigner can approve this task" error
**Root Cause:** Use case methods passing user_id to workflow service, but entities use employee_id
**Solution Applied:** 
- Updated `approve_task()`, `reject_task()`, and `assign_task_to_employee()` use cases
- Added user_id → employee_id conversion before permission validation
- **Result:** All permission validations now working correctly ✅

### **2. TaskType Enum Alignment (CRITICAL)**
**Issue:** API schema allowed different TaskType values than backend entities
**Root Cause:** `TaskTypeResponse` enum (FEATURE, BUG_FIX, etc.) didn't match `TaskType` entity (PROJECT, TASK, SUBTASK)
**Solution Applied:** 
- Aligned API schema to match backend entity enum values exactly
- **Result:** Task creation and validation now working correctly ✅

### **3. Method Name Mismatch (BLOCKING)**
**Issue:** API endpoint calling `assign_task()` but use case method named `assign_task_to_employee()`
**Solution Applied:** 
- Updated API endpoint to call correct method name
- Fixed parameter passing for assignment notes
- **Result:** Task assignment workflow now functional ✅

### **4. Parameter Name Mismatch (BLOCKING)**
**Issue:** API endpoint passing `reason` parameter but use case expecting `rejection_reason`
**Solution Applied:** 
- Updated API endpoint parameter mapping
- **Result:** Task rejection workflow now functional ✅
