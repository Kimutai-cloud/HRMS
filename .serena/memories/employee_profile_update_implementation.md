# Employee Profile Update Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented full-stack employee profile update functionality for verified users, allowing them to update basic details (name, phone, title) while maintaining security restrictions on sensitive fields (department, manager).

## Backend Implementation (Employee-Service)

### Files Modified:
1. **`Employee-Service/app/presentation/schema/profile_schema.py`**
   - Added `UpdateEmployeeDetailsRequest` schema with optional fields
   - Includes validation for first_name, last_name, phone, title
   - Field-level validation with proper trimming and length constraints

2. **`Employee-Service/app/application/dto/profile_dto.py`**
   - Added `UpdateDetailsRequest` DTO for internal communication
   - Maps API request to use case parameters

3. **`Employee-Service/app/application/use_case/profile_use_cases.py`**
   - Added `update_employee_details()` method 
   - Validates user is VERIFIED status before allowing updates
   - Tracks changes for audit logging
   - Only updates provided fields (partial update support)
   - Returns updated profile response

4. **`Employee-Service/app/presentation/api/v1/profile.py`**
   - Added `PATCH /profile/update-details` endpoint
   - Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Audit logging for all changes with before/after values
   - Authentication and authorization checks

### API Endpoint Details:
```http
PATCH /profile/update-details
Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
{
  "first_name": "NewFirstName",    // optional
  "last_name": "NewLastName",      // optional  
  "phone": "+1234567890",          // optional
  "title": "Senior Developer"      // optional
}

Response: EmployeeProfileResponse (200 OK)
```

### Security Features:
- Only VERIFIED users can update details
- Users can only update their own profiles  
- Restricted to safe fields only (no email, department, manager changes)
- Full audit trail with change tracking
- Proper validation and error handling

## Frontend Implementation (auth-frontend)

### Files Modified:
1. **`auth-frontend/src/services/employeeService.ts`**
   - Added `updateEmployeeDetails()` method calling new PATCH endpoint
   - Added helper HTTP methods (get, post, patch, delete, download)
   - Enhanced service architecture for better maintainability

2. **`auth-frontend/src/services/serviceFactory.ts`**
   - **CRITICAL FIX**: Replaced generic ApiService with actual EmployeeService instance
   - Fixed "updateEmployeeDetails is not a function" error
   - Maintained backward compatibility for all existing methods

3. **`auth-frontend/src/components/forms/SimpleProfileForm.tsx`**
   - Added verified profile detection (`isVerifiedProfile` state)
   - Enhanced form submission logic with three scenarios:
     - New profiles: `/profile/submit`
     - Rejected profiles: `/profile/resubmit` 
     - **NEW**: Verified profiles: `/profile/update-details`
   - Smart form field management:
     - Department field: Disabled for verified users
     - Manager field: Hidden for verified users
     - Name/phone/title: Always editable for verified users
   - Dynamic form titles and messaging based on user status
   - Performance optimization (skip loading departments/managers for verified users)

### Form Behavior by User Status:

**Verified Users:**
- Form Title: "Update Your Profile" 
- Subtitle: "Update your personal information as needed"
- Editable: first_name, last_name, phone, title
- Disabled/Hidden: department, manager selection
- API Call: `PATCH /profile/update-details`

**Other Users:**
- Form Title: "Complete Your Employee Profile"
- Subtitle: "Please provide your employment details..."
- Full form functionality maintained
- API Calls: `/profile/submit` or `/profile/resubmit`

## Key Technical Details

### Service Factory Fix:
The critical issue was the service factory exporting a generic `ApiService` instead of the specific `EmployeeService` class:

```typescript
// BEFORE (caused the error):
export const employeeService = createEmployeeService(); // Returns ApiService

// AFTER (fixed):  
export const employeeService = new EmployeeService(); // Returns EmployeeService with updateEmployeeDetails
```

### Form Logic Enhancement:
```typescript
// New logic handles three user scenarios:
if (hasExistingProfile && isRejectedProfile) {
  // Use resubmit endpoint
} else if (!hasExistingProfile) {
  // Use submit endpoint  
} else if (hasExistingProfile && isVerifiedProfile) {
  // NEW: Use update-details endpoint
} else {
  // Show appropriate error message
}
```

### Audit Integration:
All profile updates are logged with:
- Entity type: "employee"
- Action: "PROFILE_DETAILS_UPDATED" 
- Before/after change tracking
- User ID, IP address, user agent
- Timestamp and request context

## Benefits Achieved

1. **User Experience**: Verified employees can now update their basic information
2. **Security**: Sensitive fields (department, manager) remain protected
3. **Audit Compliance**: Full traceability of all profile changes
4. **Performance**: Optimized form loading for verified users
5. **Maintainability**: Clean separation between profile creation/resubmission vs updates
6. **Flexibility**: Partial updates supported (only send changed fields)

## Testing Verification

- ✅ Backend API syntax validation passed
- ✅ Frontend TypeScript compilation validated
- ✅ Service factory method resolution confirmed
- ✅ Form logic properly handles all user scenarios
- ✅ Error handling provides user-friendly feedback

This implementation provides verified employees with self-service profile update capabilities while maintaining the security and audit requirements of the HRMS system.
