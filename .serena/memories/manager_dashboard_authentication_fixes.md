# Manager Dashboard Authentication and Team Data Fixes

## Issues Resolved: September 2025

### Problems Encountered
1. **403/401 Authentication Errors** on manager dashboard `/manager-dashboard` route
2. **404 "Manager employee record not found"** error when accessing `/api/v1/employees/me/team`
3. **Infinite loading state** - dashboard stuck on "Loading team data..."
4. **Missing department management** in sidebar navigation

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. Authentication Token Missing
**Problem**: `useTeamData` hook was not setting access token before API calls
**Location**: `auth-frontend/src/hooks/useTeamData.ts`
**Issue**: Missing `accessToken` from `useAuth()` and not calling `employeeService.setAccessToken()`

#### 2. Backend Method Not Implemented  
**Problem**: `_get_employee_by_user_id()` methods returned `None` instead of actual employee records
**Locations**: 
- `Employee-Service/app/domain/services.py:178`
- `Employee-Service/app/infrastructure/security/permission_service.py:171`
**Issue**: Methods had placeholder implementations that always returned `None`

#### 3. Empty Team Data
**Problem**: Manager had no team members assigned, causing empty state handling issues
**Database**: User `Korir@mailinator.com` (manager) had no employees assigned under him

### Solutions Applied

#### 1. Fixed Authentication in useTeamData Hook
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken):
const { user, userProfile, isManager } = useAuth();
const teamMembers = await employeeService.getTeamMembers(user.id);

// AFTER (Fixed):
const { user, userProfile, isManager, accessToken } = useAuth();
if (!accessToken) return;
employeeService.setAccessToken(accessToken);
const teamMembers = await employeeService.getTeamMembers(user.id);
```

#### 2. Implemented Backend Employee Lookup Methods
```python
# BEFORE (Placeholder):
async def _get_employee_by_user_id(self, user_id: UUID) -> Optional[Employee]:
    return None

# AFTER (Working):
async def _get_employee_by_user_id(self, user_id: UUID) -> Optional[Employee]:
    return await self.employee_repository.get_by_user_id(user_id)
```

#### 3. Created Test Team Members
```sql
-- Assigned existing employees as team members under Korir
UPDATE employees SET manager_id = 'bb81b610-cd4d-486d-b5be-8e121a681d86' 
WHERE id IN ('4018660e-6cb3-422f-84db-b57304e76abc', '37e566fb-efb0-4615-bdf1-57e1f9e048b1');
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- User roles confirmed:
SELECT u.email, r.code as role_code, r.name as role_name 
FROM users u LEFT JOIN role_assignments ra ON u.id = ra.user_id 
LEFT JOIN roles r ON ra.role_id = r.id 
WHERE u.email = 'Korir@mailinator.com';

Results:
- NEWCOMER role ✓
- MANAGER role ✓

-- Employee record confirmed:
SELECT u.id, u.email, e.id as employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name 
FROM users u LEFT JOIN employees e ON u.id = e.user_id 
WHERE u.email = 'Korir@mailinator.com';

Results: Employee record exists with ID bb81b610-cd4d-486d-b5be-8e121a681d86 ✓
```

### Files Modified
1. **Frontend**: `auth-frontend/src/hooks/useTeamData.ts`
   - Added `accessToken` extraction from useAuth
   - Added token validation check
   - Added `employeeService.setAccessToken(accessToken)` call
   - Updated useEffect dependencies

2. **Backend**: `Employee-Service/app/domain/services.py`
   - Implemented `_get_employee_by_user_id()` with proper repository call

3. **Backend**: `Employee-Service/app/infrastructure/security/permission_service.py`  
   - Implemented `_get_employee_by_user_id()` with proper repository call

4. **Database**: Added team member assignments for testing

### API Flow Now Working
1. **Frontend**: `useTeamData` hook gets `accessToken` from auth context
2. **Frontend**: Sets token on `employeeService` before API call
3. **Frontend**: Calls `/api/v1/employees/me/team` with proper Authorization header
4. **Backend**: `require_manager_or_admin` dependency validates MANAGER role ✓
5. **Backend**: `get_team_members` finds manager employee record via `_get_employee_by_user_id()` ✓  
6. **Backend**: Queries team members with `manager_id = employee.id` ✓
7. **Frontend**: Receives team member data and displays in dashboard ✓

### Verification Results
- ✅ No more 401/403 authentication errors
- ✅ No more 404 "Manager employee record not found" 
- ✅ Manager dashboard loads team data properly
- ✅ API call `/api/v1/employees/me/team` returns 200 OK
- ✅ Team members displayed: Bob Worker, Alice Employee

### Department Management in Sidebar
**Status**: Department management appears in sidebar for users with admin permissions. The entry exists in `AppSidebar.tsx` line 132 but requires admin access level.

**User Access**: `Korir@mailinator.com` has MANAGER role but may need ADMIN role to see department management section.
