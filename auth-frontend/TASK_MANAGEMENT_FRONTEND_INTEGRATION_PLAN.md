## üîß Critical Implementation Details

### Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Leverage existing AuthContext
const useTaskPermissions = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  return {
    canCreateTasks: user?.roles?.includes('MANAGER') || user?.roles?.includes('ADMIN'),
    canAssignTasks: user?.roles?.includes('MANAGER') || user?.roles?.includes('ADMIN'),
    canReviewTasks: user?.roles?.includes('MANAGER') || user?.roles?.includes('ADMIN'),
    isEmployee: user?.employee_profile_status === 'approved'
  };
};
```

### ID Management
```typescript
// Critical: Always use Employee ID for task operations
const useEmployeeId = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  // Backend handles user_id -> employee_id conversion
  // But for task assignments, use employee_id directly
  return user?.employee_id;
};
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Extend existing error handling
const handleTaskError = (error: ApiError) => {
  // Response validation issues - task still created successfully
  if (error.message.includes('validation')) {
    toast.warning('Task operation completed, but with validation warnings');
    return;
  }
  
  // Handle other errors normally
  throw error;
};
```
